                        This porject was created during a 24 hour hackathon earlier this year with some of my friends. The idea is to be able to take in a sentence and then give back an itenrary that would reflect the feeling of the sentence. This was accomplished through using a <a href = "https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">Natural Language Processing</a> model. From the output, I used the Maps API to compare reviews. <a href = "https://github.com/TheMattWang/vibe">Github Link</a>

                    <p>
                        In Mid-May, I joined <a href = "https://cybersecurity.tamu.edu/about-us/people/">Dr.Christopher Lanclos</a> on his Malware Detection team. I'm tasked with reading scientific articles for a Literature Review that is planned on being published later this year. In addition, I'm on the Dynamic Team, using Python, <a href = "https://cuckoosandbox.org/"> Cuckoos Sandbox</a>, and various <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/">Clustering Machine Learning</a> to find new ways to discover what's the most efficient way to find malware.
